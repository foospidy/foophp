# foophp
A very basic PHP application framework. This is for the developer that wants a light weight framework to quickly build an API service, single page app, or a typical PHP app. The framework basically provides a structure to build under, but does not constrain you to it. In addition it provides some basic security "on by default" features.

If you need a more advanced and feature rich framework then you should check out:
